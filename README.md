[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/17f4b637-9044-4b4c-87ec-c113fe782332/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zacs/deploys)
This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I've maitained it to be as simple as possible to use. Do note create-react-app is no longer best practice. This is a simple portfolio website that I use for my own personal use. I've made it open source so that others can use it as well.

## Available Scripts
```
npm i # install deps
npm run start # for dev
npm run build # for production (locally)
```

## Customize

> 🏗️ Under development

You can change the website for your own personal use by tweaking the `Config.ts`
file.
